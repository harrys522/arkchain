# make a connected graph of all users in rundemo.py (start with 4 nodes for now)
# The total number of connections (edges of the graph) are scaled accordingly with the number of users (i.e. scaled dynamically)
# the peers of a user are represented by edges that are connected between them
# make a way for a user to request new peers and then add peers for that particular user (in the form of edges in the graph)
# When broadcasting (sharing information across the network) it should start with one user which is then given to only their peers. 
# Then, the peers of that user will share with their peers and so on until the broadcast is complete.
# Note that information broadcasted cannot go backward to peers to previously sent it to current peers)
