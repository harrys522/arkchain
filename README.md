## ArkChain: The future of data verification

ArkChain is a experimental project that is not fully developed, do not use this code for anything important. This code is provided as-is with no guarantee of functionality or liability to the author, it should be considered academic-grade.

### Design
Arkchain takes is a prototype for decentralised security through a novel approach to data integrity. We allow different nodes to validate data which is identified by a unique hash, so that no extra information or heavy payloads are shared throughout the network. Only the metadata including claimed source and file hash are communicated through the network, we use an arkblock structure to group data based on it's context / source.

## Running the demonstration
To run the demo, you can use a very simple command to run a script that will simulate the functionality of our solution.

Navigate to the directory of /arkchain
Terminal: python3 rundemo.py
